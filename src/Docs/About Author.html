            <p>
                I love building and rebuilding brands through my specific skills.
                Using color, fonts, and illustration. I love helping peoples 
                me. I always enjoyed science, math, and technical things as a kid,
                but I didn't get into computer Sciences until I was in 7th grade.
                I also interested in solving puzzles etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                After getting into Computer Sciences I also tried Graphic Designing
                and Sketching, but not too much interested. One of which design I am
                using as my logo and another that I used as logo for GwBasic.Net icon.

                At very earlier stag of my life, I was interested in technology and
                Computers. But, after 7th grade I adopted Computer Science as my passion
                and, wrote my Hello World program using python. then I learnt VB, HTML +
                CSS, JavaScript and then again python. But, I don't have anything to do
                so my knowledge as less as a beginner. My first proper project is Calcunut
                Base Convertor that I wrote first in python than attempt using C# (still
                incomplete). At that moment I hit upon an idea about a website and started
                building that website using ASP.NET MVC 3. But, as I don't have any Knowledge
                about database and other web things and also the project is too large to me
                so, I decided to left the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's about start of my 10 grade when againhave an idea but now it's more
                tough, time consuming and i also have no knowledge about it. It's about
                the compiler for GwBasic that compiles the GwBasic code into python code
                and then this python code is converted in an exe using pyinstaller or
                directly GwBasic is converted into exe file that I executable on any machine
                (Windows, Linux and Mac). But, as that's too much tough for me so I stop
                thinking about it and begin to create a Syntax Editor using C# WinForm, the
                syntax highlighting is done by Fast Color Text box.
